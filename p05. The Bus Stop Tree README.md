# The Bus Stop Tree

This repository contains the implementation for **The Bus Stop Tree**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed in Fall 2023. The project builds a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** that organizes Madison Metro bus schedule data, allowing users to quickly find the next available buses at a given stop.

## Features
- **Binary Search Tree Implementation**:
  - Stores bus schedules in a **BST**, sorting buses by **arrival time**.
  - Efficient **insertion, lookup, and traversal** of bus data.
- **Madison Metro Bus Schedule Integration**:
  - Uses **real-world transit data** to determine bus arrivals.
  - Supports **API-based bus scheduling**.
- **Recursive BST Operations**:
  - Implements **recursive add, search, and traversal** functions.
  - Supports **filtering and iteration** over BST elements.
- **Iterator for Bus Queries**:
  - **Forwards iterator**: Finds buses arriving **after** a given time.
  - **Filtered iterator**: Retrieves **only** buses stopping at a given destination.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive **unit tests** ensure BST correctness.
  - Tests recursive methods and edge cases.

## Files Included
- `Bus.java`: Implements **bus objects** with route details and arrival times.
- `BusStopTree.java`: Implements the **BST** to store and retrieve bus schedules.
- `BusFilteredIterator.java`: Defines an **iterator** to filter buses based on destination.
- `BusStopTreeTester.java`: Contains **unit tests** to verify BST operations.
- `BusDriver.java`: Provides a **main method** to load and process bus schedule data.
- `BusForwardsIterator.java`: Implements an **iterator** for retrieving next buses.
- `bus.jar`: A library for handling **bus route and stop data**.
- `P09 The Bus Stop Tree.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and understand its efficiency.
- Apply **recursive algorithms** for **adding, searching, and filtering** BST elements.
- Work with **iterators** to traverse and filter data **without modifying the structure**.
- Utilize **real-world API data** for practical applications.
- Develop and execute **unit tests** to validate BST functionality.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Add `bus.jar` to the **Build Path**.
4. Download the **Metro Transit Schedule Data** from:
   - [Madison Metro GTFS Data](http://transitdata.cityofmadison.com/GTFS/mmt_gtfs.zip)
5. Extract the data into the project folder **`mmt_gtfs`**.
6. Compile and run `BusDriver.java` to interact with the **bus schedule query system**.
7. Run `BusStopTreeTester.java` to verify **BST functionality**.

# Froggie Feeding Frenzie

This repository contains the implementation for **Froggie Feeding Frenzie**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed in Fall 2023. This project builds upon previous GUI assignments by integrating **object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, interfaces, and event-driven programming** using the **Processing** graphics library.

## Features
- **Graphical Game with Processing**:
  - The game features **Froggie**, a frog that tries to eat as many bugs as possible.
  - Uses **Processing’s** built-in rendering and event-handling capabilities.
- **OOP and Inheritance**:
  - Implements a **GameActor** base class for all game objects.
  - Various types of **Bugs** (`Bug`, `BouncingBug`, `CirclingBug`, `StrongBug`), each with different behaviors.
- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Players **drag** Froggie with the mouse.
  - Froggie can launch its **tongue** to eat bugs.
  - Different bug types have **unique movement and behavior**.
  - **StrongBugs** require multiple hits to be eaten.
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Uses **hitboxes** to detect when Froggie’s tongue hits a bug.
  - Implements a **custom Hitbox class** for accurate collision detection.
- **Polymorphism & Interfaces**:
  - Implements the **Moveable interface** for moving game objects.
  - Demonstrates **method overriding** with the `@Override` annotation.

## Files Included
- `FrogGame.java`: The **main game loop** using Processing’s `PApplet`.
- `GameActor.java`: Abstract base class for all interactive game objects.
- `Frog.java`: Represents Froggie, the main character, with **dragging and attack mechanics**.
- `Bug.java`: Base class for bugs that Froggie eats.
- `BouncingBug.java`: A bug that **bounces around** the screen like a DVD logo.
- `CirclingBug.java`: A bug that **moves in a circular path**.
- `StrongBug.java`: A **hard-to-eat bug** that requires multiple hits.
- `Hitbox.java`: Implements **collision detection** for all objects.
- `Moveable.java`: An interface for objects that **move dynamically**.
- `core.jar`: The **Processing library** required for GUI rendering.
- `images/`: A directory containing sprite images for rendering game elements.
- `P05 - Froggie Feeding Frenzie.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply **inheritance and polymorphism** to model game objects.
- Implement **collision detection** using custom hitboxes.
- Utilize **Processing’s event-driven programming model** for interactive gameplay.
- Define and use **interfaces** to enforce behavior across multiple classes.
- Work with **file-based assets** (images) in a Java program.
- Override methods using the `@Override` annotation to customize behavior.

## Running the Game
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Add `core.jar` to the **Build Path**.
4. Unzip the `images.zip` file and place the **images folder** inside your project directory.
5. Run `FrogGame.java` to launch the game.
6. **Controls**:
   - **Drag Froggie** with the mouse.
   - **Press keys** to spawn bugs (depending on implementation).
   - **Launch Froggie's tongue** to eat bugs.

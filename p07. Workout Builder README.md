# Workout Builder

This repository contains the implementation for **Workout Builder**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed in Fall 2023. This project focuses on **linked list data structures** by implementing a **custom singly-linked list** to organize workouts into **warm-ups, main exercises, and cool-downs**.

## Features
- **Singly-Linked List Implementation**:
  - Uses **LinkedExercise** nodes to construct a **WorkoutBuilder** list.
  - Supports **dynamic insertion and removal** of exercises in different workout sections.
- **Workout Organization**:
  - Exercises are automatically **sorted** into **warm-up, primary, and cool-down** categories.
  - **Preserves insertion order** within each category.
- **Exercise Management**:
  - Each exercise is assigned a **unique ID number** starting from 1.
  - Supports **removal of specific exercises** by ID.
- **Unit Testing & Debugging**:
  - Implements **comprehensive unit tests** to verify correctness.
  - Supports **demo output** for debugging and validation.

## Files Included
- `WorkoutBuilder.java`: Implements the **singly-linked list** for managing workout exercises.
- `LinkedExercise.java`: Defines **list nodes** containing exercise data and links.
- `WorkoutBuilderTester.java`: Contains **unit tests** and a **demo method** for testing the implementation.
- `Exercise.java`: Represents **exercise objects** with workout type and unique ID.
- `ListADT.java`: Defines the **abstract data type (ADT)** for the linked list structure.
- `P07 - Workout Builder.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how **data is stored and manipulated** in a **singly-linked list**.
- Implement **linked list operations** including **insertion, deletion, and traversal**.
- Apply **abstract data types (ADTs)** to define structured data operations.
- Develop **unit tests** to verify linked list functionality and edge cases.
- Use **custom enums** (`WorkoutType`) to classify list elements.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Compile all Java files.
4. Run `WorkoutBuilderTester.java` to execute **unit tests** and verify correctness.
5. Use `demo()` in `WorkoutBuilderTester.java` to see an example workout sequence.

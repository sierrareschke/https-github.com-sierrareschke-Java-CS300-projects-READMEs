# Among Us GUI Simulation

This repository contains the implementation for the **Among Us GUI Simulation**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed individually as part of the Fall 2023 semester. The project introduces the use of the **Processing** graphical user interface (GUI) library through a simplified space station simulation.

## Features
- **GUI-Based Application**: Implements a graphical environment using the Processing library.
- **Amogus Sprites**: Generates and manages Amogus characters with random colors and positions.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: 
  - Players can spawn new Amoguses using the keyboard.
  - Amoguses can be dragged with the mouse.
  - An impostor is randomly assigned and can "unalive" other Amoguses upon collision.
- **Event Handling**: Implements key and mouse event listeners for user interaction.

## Files Included
- `SpaceStation.java`: Implements the main logic for rendering Amogus sprites and handling user interactions.
- `p02core.jar`: Contains the core Processing library and the provided Utility and Amogus classes.
- `images/`: A directory containing sprite images for rendering Amogus characters.
- `P02 - Among Us.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and use Java objects and methods in a GUI context.
- Work with graphical event-driven programming using Processing.
- Implement callback methods (`setup()`, `draw()`, `mousePressed()`, `keyPressed()`) to manage interactive elements.
- Detect and handle object interactions (dragging, collisions).
- Follow structured programming and adhere to CS 300 course style guidelines.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure Java 17 is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Add `p02core.jar` to the projectâ€™s **Build Path**.
4. Run `SpaceStation.java` to launch the graphical application.
5. Interact using:
   - **'A' key**: Adds a new Amogus to the scene (up to 8).
   - **Mouse Drag**: Moves Amoguses around.
   - **Impostor Mechanics**: The impostor can eliminate other Amoguses by dragging over them.

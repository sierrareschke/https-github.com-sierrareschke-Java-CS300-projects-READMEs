# Airplane Boarding System

This repository contains the implementation for **Airplane Boarding System**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed in Fall 2023. The project focuses on **priority queues, min-heaps, and the Comparable interface** to efficiently manage an airplane boarding process.

## Features
- **Priority-Based Boarding Queue**:
  - Implements a **priority queue using a min-heap**.
  - Assigns boarding priority based on **passenger groups**:
    - **Group A**: Highest priority – business class, seniors, and passengers with disabilities.
    - **Group B**: Medium priority – pregnant passengers and families with children.
    - **Group C**: Lowest priority – all other passengers.
- **Min-Heap Implementation**:
  - Stores passengers in a **heap-based priority queue**.
  - Ensures **earliest arrival within the same group boards first**.
- **Passenger Management**:
  - Passengers have **names, boarding groups, arrival orders, and check-in statuses**.
  - Supports **boarding, peeking, and cancellation of boarding**.
- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**:
  - Allows users to **enqueue passengers, start boarding, and list passengers**.
  - Implements a **menu-driven text interface**.
- **Exception Handling**:
  - Prevents boarding for **unchecked-in passengers**.
  - Handles **empty queue operations** safely.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive **unit tests** validate queue operations and passenger comparisons.
  - Tests **edge cases, ordering, and exception handling**.

## Files Included
- `Passenger.java`: Implements **passenger objects** with names, groups, and arrival orders.
- `BoardingQueue.java`: Implements a **min-heap priority queue** for managing boarding order.
- `BoardingSystemTester.java`: Contains **unit tests** to verify the correctness of the boarding system.
- `BoardingSystemDriver.java`: Provides a **command-line interface** to simulate boarding.
- `P10 Airplane Boarding System.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement a **priority queue using a min-heap array**.
- Understand and apply the **Comparable interface** for custom ordering.
- Manage **heap-based insertion, removal, and reordering operations**.
- Work with **enumerations** for structured data management.
- Develop and execute **unit tests** for robust software validation.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Compile all Java files.
4. Run `BoardingSystemDriver.java` to launch the **interactive text-based boarding system**.
5. Run `BoardingSystemTester.java` to execute **unit tests** and validate the program.
6. Follow the **menu options** to:
   - Enqueue passengers.
   - Peek at the next passenger to board.
   - Start the boarding process.
   - List passengers in the queue and those who have boarded.
   - Cancel the boarding queue.

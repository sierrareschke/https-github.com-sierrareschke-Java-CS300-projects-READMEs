# Course Enrollment System

This repository contains the implementation for the **Course Enrollment System**, a Programming II (CS300) assignment completed individually as part of the Fall 2023 semester. The project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, including the use of control structures, arrays, custom methods, and algorithm decomposition.

## Features
- **Student Enrollment**: Add students to courses if prerequisites are satisfied and capacity is available.
- **Waitlist Management**: Automatically place students on a waitlist if a course is full, with the ability to move them to the roster when a seat becomes available.
- **Course Management**: Drop students from courses, print enrollment rosters, and manage waitlists.
- **Administrative Tools**: Modify course capacities and generate enrollment reports.

## Files Included
- `CourseEnrollment.java`: Implements the main functionality of the enrollment system, including roster and waitlist management.
- `CourseEnrollmentTester.java`: Contains unit tests for verifying the correctness of the implemented methods.
- `CourseEnrollmentDriver.java`: Provides a text-based user interface for interacting with the system.
- `CS300_Fall_2023_P01_Course_Enrollment_System.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Practice control structures, loops, and method decomposition in Java.
- Manage data using oversize and perfect-size 2D arrays.
- Develop and execute unit tests to validate code functionality.
- Gain experience adhering to a style guide and automated testing requirements.

## Running the Program
1. Compile all Java files using a Java 17-compatible environment.
2. Execute `CourseEnrollmentDriver.java` to launch the command-line interface.
3. Follow the interactive menu options to simulate course enrollment scenarios.

# Grade Policies Simulator

This repository contains the implementation for the **Grade Policies Simulator**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed individually as part of the Fall 2023 semester. The project focuses on **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** and **data management** by simulating the CS300 grading policies.

## Features
- **Custom Data Types**: Implements Java classes to store and manage assignment grades.
- **Grade Calculation**: Supports different grading policies, including:
  - **Standard Assignment Group**: Stores a collection of assignments.
  - **Scaling Assignment Group**: Scales grades based on a maximum threshold.
  - **Drop Assignment Group**: Automatically drops the lowest scores from grade calculations.
- **Grade Projection**: Uses a provided **CS300Grader** class to estimate final grades.
- **ArrayList Integration**: Uses Java's `ArrayList` for dynamic assignment storage.

## Files Included
- `SimpleAssignment.java`: Defines an assignment object with scores and completion status.
- `AssignmentGroup.java`: Stores multiple `SimpleAssignment` objects.
- `ScalingAssignmentGroup.java`: Implements a scaled grading policy.
- `DropAssignmentGroup.java`: Implements a policy that drops the lowest assignment scores.
- `SimpleAssignmentTester.java`: Contains unit tests for validating `SimpleAssignment` functionality.
- `AssignmentGroupTester.java`: Contains unit tests for validating different grading policies.
- `P03 - Grade Policies.pdf`: The assignment specification document.
- **(Not submitted)** `CS300Grader.java`: A provided class for grade projection (not required for submission).

## Learning Objectives
- Implement a **custom data type** using private fields, constructors, and accessor/mutator methods.
- Utilize **ArrayLists** for dynamic data storage and management.
- Apply **Object-Oriented Design principles** to model real-world grading scenarios.
- Develop **unit tests** to verify the correctness of implemented methods.
- Adhere to **CS 300 style guidelines** for readable and maintainable code.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and configured in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Compile and run `SimpleAssignmentTester.java` and `AssignmentGroupTester.java` to validate implementation.

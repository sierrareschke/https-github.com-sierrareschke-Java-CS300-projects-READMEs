# Ticket Rush Queue System

This repository contains the implementation for **Ticket Rush**, a **CS 300: Programming II** assignment completed in Fall 2023. The project focuses on implementing a **queue-based ticket-selling system** using a **singly-linked list**, enforcing **anti-scalping measures**, and integrating an **iterator for queue traversal**.

## Features
- **Queue-Based Ticket Management**:
  - Implements a **limited-capacity queue** to control ticket purchases.
  - Users must be **logged in** and **ticketless** to enter the queue.
  - Supports **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** processing of ticket buyers.
- **Linked List Implementation**:
  - Uses a **custom `LinkedNode` class** to store users in the queue.
  - Implements **enqueue, dequeue, peek, and deep copy methods**.
- **Iterator for Queue Traversal**:
  - Implements the **Iterator and Iterable interfaces** for queue traversal.
  - Allows users to check their **position in line** without modifying the queue.
- **Exception Handling & Validations**:
  - Prevents **duplicate queue entries**.
  - Ensures **proper exception handling** for invalid operations.
- **Unit Testing**:
  - Comprehensive **unit tests** verify queue behavior and edge cases.
  - Validates **correct queue order and deep copy functionality**.

## Files Included
- `TicketQueue.java`: Implements the **singly-linked queue** for managing ticket purchases.
- `TicketQueueIterator.java`: Defines an **iterator** for traversing the queue without modifying it.
- `TicketQueueTester.java`: Contains **unit tests** to validate queue operations.
- `Ticket.java`: Represents a **ticket object** with event details.
- `TicketSiteUser.java`: Defines **users**, enforcing login and ticket ownership rules.
- `QueueADT.java`: Abstract **queue interface** defining required queue operations.
- `LinkedNode.java`: Implements a **generic singly-linked node** used in the queue.
- `P08 - Ticket Rush.pdf`: The assignment specification document.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand **queue data structures** and their **linked list implementations**.
- Implement **FIFO queue operations** using a **singly-linked list**.
- Use **iterators** to traverse data structures **without modifying them**.
- Handle **edge cases and exceptions** in a real-world queueing system.
- Develop and execute **unit tests** to verify queue behavior.

## Running the Program
1. Ensure **Java 17** is installed and set up in your development environment.
2. Import the project into **Eclipse** (or another Java IDE).
3. Compile all Java files.
4. Run `TicketQueueTester.java` to execute **unit tests** and verify functionality.
5. Use `toString()` to visualize the queue structure.
